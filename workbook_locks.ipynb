    "When both processes first start running the `work` function, they see that no file named `parallel.txt` currently exists. Therefore, each process starts trying to count from zero. You should have seen the message \"File doesn't exist, starting to count from 0\" printed twice, reflecting this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's arbitrary which process will succeed in writing to file first, an issue known as a \"race condition.\" As one process is in the middle of writing, its possible that the other process will read the partially saved results. This partial data cannot be read properly (it appears as an empty string), causing the exception. We've structured our code so that when a process can't read the file's data, it assumes it should start the count at 0. Therefore, when the processes read the file as the other as writing, they reset the counter! This is why the final count is much lower than we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions such as these can introduce bugs to our code that are hard to track down, as they are not reliably reproducible. We can use \"locks\" to prevent multiple processes from accessing the same resource (e.g. a file or variable) at the same time, preventing the race condition from creating bugs.
