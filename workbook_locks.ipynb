    "Programs that are pleasantly parallel don't have to have their processes share any information about their \"state\". Unfortunately, not every problem we want to solve can be pleasantly parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its common for our programs to need to write something to file. As we'll see in this workbook, multiple processes writing to the same file at the same time is a recipe for disaster. We'll learn a couple ways to handle this problem and examine their impact on our program's weak scaling.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When both processes first start running the `work` function, they see that no file named `parallel.txt` currently exists. Therefore, each process starts trying to count from zero. You should have seen the message \"File doesn't exist, starting to count from 0\" printed twice, reflecting this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's arbitrary which process will succeed in writing to file first, an issue known as a \"race condition.\" As one process is in the middle of writing, its possible that the other process will read the partially saved results. This partial data cannot be read properly (it appears as an empty string), causing the exception. We've structured our code so that when a process can't read the file's data, it assumes it should start the count at 0. Therefore, when the processes read the file as the other as writing, they reset the counter! This is why the final count is much lower than we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions such as these can introduce bugs to our code that are hard to track down, as they are not reliably reproducible. We can use \"locks\" to prevent multiple processes from accessing the same resource (e.g. a file or variable) at the same time, preventing the race condition from creating bugs. We'll learn some implementations for locks in the following section.\n"

    "We can use the `fasteners` module to ensure that only one process may write to a file at a time. This library makes use of *decorators*, a feature of the Python language that allows us to easily extend the behavior of functions.\n",

The directory `/tmp/local` is a [*local filesystem*](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/Local_File_Systems/) and is **only accessible to the node you're running on.** If you're using processes from multiple nodes, you'll need to change the location of your lock file to something like your home directory (this will never happen with OnDemand).\n",
